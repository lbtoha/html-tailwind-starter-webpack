# Images

This folder contains the actual images used in the project. If you want to replace any of these images, just add your own image file with the same filename in this folder and replace the existing file.

Example:

Let's say you want to replace the `logo.png` image. You would add a new image file named `logo.png` to the `src/assets/images` folder and replace the existing `logo.png` file.
